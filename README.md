# TodoApp

This is my first ASP.NET Core aplication - a simple TODO app.

I decided to use Minimal API approach, since it is something new to me (I have already made controller-based applications in Java, but I am sure that in the future I will also use this approach in .NET).

To create this app, I used official Microsoft documentation.

The application is also connceted to MS SQL Server and uses Entity Framework to map objects to records.
